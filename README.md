# MedScanAi
# 🧠 Medical Image Segmentation Platform

A full-stack web application for **segmentation of medical images**, built using **React** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend. The app allows doctors to register/login, manage patient data, upload and segment medical images using a deep learning model, and optionally export  and save or visualize 3d results.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. 📥 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/syrine-ammar/MedScanAi.git
cd MedScanAi
```

---

### 2. 🔙 Backend Setup (Flask)

Navigate to the `server/` directory:

```bash
cd server
```

📦 Install backend dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure the following Python libraries are installed:

```text
Flask
Flask-Cors
Flask-PyMongo
pillow
tensorflow==2.15.0
numpy==1.26.4
opencv-python
trimesh
```

▶️ Run Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, it runs at: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

---

### 3. 🧩 Frontend Setup (React)

Navigate to the `client/` directory:

```bash
cd ../client
```

📦 Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm install react-router-dom axios jszip file-saver jspdf three
```

Ensure your `package.json` includes the following dependencies:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "axios": "^1.6.0",
  "jszip": "^3.10.0",
  "file-saver": "^2.0.5",
  "react-router-dom": "^6.14.1",
  "three": "^0.157.0"
}
```

▶️ Run React app:

```bash
npm start
```

By default, it runs at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

### 🧠 Model Files

Ensure you have the following model files inside the `server/models/` directory:

```
test_architecture.json
test_best_weights.h5
```

These files should match the architecture  trained ( U-Net ).

 #you should have tensorflow v2.15.0 to run this type of model

### 🌐 Environment Notes

- MongoDB must be running locally at: `mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase`
- 8.0 mongo version 
- ✅ Python version: **>= 3.8**
- ✅ Node.js version: **>= 16**




  ## 🧰 MongoDB Setup 

This project uses **MongoDB** as its database. Follow these steps if you're new:

### 🔧 1. Install MongoDB Community Edition

- Download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community
- Install and leave all default settings.
- MongoDB will run locally at: `mongodb://localhost:27017`

---

### 📊 2. Install MongoDB Compass (Optional UI)

MongoDB Compass is a visual GUI to explore and manage your database.

- Download: https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass
- After installing, open Compass and connect to:

```
mongodb://localhost:27017
```

You can visually browse your collections (`doctors`, `patients`, etc.).

### ▶️ 3. Run MongoDB

MongoDB typically runs automatically as a background service. To ensure it's running:

- On **Windows**:
  - Open Command Prompt  go to where you installed monoDB server/bin:
  
  -  run:
    ```bash
    mongod
    ```
### 🧪 Test Your MongoDB Connection


in compass shell:
You should enter the Mongo shell. To view databases:

```bash
show dbs
```

---

### 🛠 Example: Creating the Project Database

Once MongoDB is running, the Flask app will automatically use:

```
mongodb://localhost:27017/myDatabase
```

You don't need to create `myDatabase` manually — it will be created when the app runs and stores data (doctors/patients).

---

✅ **You're now ready to run the Flask and React apps with MongoDB support!**
